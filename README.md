# The Role of Image Resolution in CNN Training

This repository contains the code and report for a university project investigating how image resolution affects the training efficiency and performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The project evaluates the trade-off between classification accuracy and computational cost when training identical CNN models on different image resolutions.

## Project Description
Image resolution plays a crucial role in computer vision tasks. While higher resolutions preserve more visual detail, they also increase memory usage and training time.  
In this project, we train the same CNN architecture from scratch on a fruit image dataset using multiple image resolutions and compare:

- Training time
- Validation loss
- Test accuracy

The goal is to identify how resolution choice impacts model performance and practicality.
